Project Title: Home Credit Default Risk Prediction

Project Description:

Developed a machine learning model to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants, contributing to risk management and reduced loan default rates.
Key Achievements:

Designed and implemented a predictive model using a combination of traditional credit scoring data and alternative data sources.
Conducted extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and missing value imputation to enhance model accuracy.
Achieved a [specify performance metric, e.g., ROC AUC score] demonstrating the model's high predictive accuracy.
Collaborated with cross-functional teams to integrate the model into the loan approval process, resulting in a [specify reduction percentage] decrease in loan default rates.
Regularly updated and retrained the model to adapt to changing market conditions and improve overall portfolio performance.
Technologies/Tools Used:
